.. title:: Tau, a minimal library for PHP

Installation
============
Place the contents of the repository where you'd like, for example your project's *lib* folder. Then include it.

.. code-block:: php
    require_once 'lib/Tau.php';
  
As this library was developed circa 2010, and as far as the author knows, not in use outside of personal
projects, there is no composer package available.
